# Blood-Donation-System


The project is a Blood Donation Management System made for the central Palestinian blood bank at Ramallah. The purpose of this project is to replace the traditional blood donation system with a developed modern data base management system that will manage the donation operation in a simple and effective way. The implementation of this project will be done with the help of MySQL and java.

The current system used by the client side depends on the employeeâ€™s manual effort in sorting, listing, searching, recording and managing the blood test units which could lead to multiple mistakes like mixing of samples that may lead to life loss. Moreover, it is time consuming, requires a lot of man power and the error percentage is high.

The goal of the project is to provide a simple, rapid and efficient process for managing the donation operation and access to blood units. The project aims to maintain the information regarding the blood bank, blood donors, and different blood groups available at the central blood bank. It will facilitate hospitals work in tracking and searching for the right donor easily.
